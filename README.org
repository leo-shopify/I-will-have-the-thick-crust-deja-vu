* The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Dynamic Typing for Practical Programs

Video: https://vimeo.com/74354480

Author did /his own research/ where he scanned github, 1.7 million repos, 3.6
million issue to get some data.

Python: Out of 670,000 issues only *3 percent* were type errors.

For all the dynamic languages he checked only *2% of the errors* were *type errors*.

Debug time of the exceptions that could have been caught by a type checker.\\
*<* Time required to handle the type checker.

*But...*

C++ programs had the least number of errors.

/What?/ C++ is too complex /and/ statically typed.

Most used code bases (as libraries to other languages).

Valuable to more projects. Under more scrutiny.
