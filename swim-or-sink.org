If constant movement means giving up on /understanding/ then there is no point
of reference.

Any direction has the same weight, the same cost, the same value.

There is a chance to go around in circles, perceiving superficial variations as
progress.

... and Measuring without understanding is not a solution.

There is no way to tell whether the variations are fundamental or just different
units.

- Customer :: Six, I don't think I could eat eight slices.
