* Doubting Funes

"The tale of one Ireneo Funes, who, after falling off his horse and receiving a
bad head injury, acquired the amazing talent of remembering absolutely
everything." [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funes_the_Memorious][â€ ]]

Remembering a day took him one day.

Every blade of grass was different than the others. Every instant of that blade
was unique.

There were no abstractions. Everything was concrete, unambiguous.

He lost the ability to think and comunicate.

Words and ideas are necessarily lossy representations.

Maybe when writting programs we can't lose information, but perhaps we can gain
something by controlling the way we arrange it?
