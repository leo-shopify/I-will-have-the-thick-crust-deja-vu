In Athenian democracy was someone who was characterized by self-centeredness and
concerned almost exclusively with private—as opposed to public—affairs.

It was the natural state of ignorance into which all persons were born and its
opposite, citizenship, was effected through formalized education.

It originally referred to “layman, person lacking professional skill”,
“person so mentally deficient as to be incapable of ordinary reasoning”.

Over time, the term shifted away from its original connotation of selfishness
and came to refer to individuals with overall bad judgment–individuals who are
“stupid”.
